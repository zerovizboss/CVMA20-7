### Overview
Comprehensive implementation of enterprise-grade Salesforce best practices including centralized error handling, enhanced security, performance optimization, and improved test infrastructure.

### Core Components Implemented âœ…

#### CVMAErrorHandler Framework
- **Purpose**: Centralized error handling and logging across the CVMA application
- **Features**: 
  - Severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
  - Error categories (SECURITY, DATA_VALIDATION, INTEGRATION, PERFORMANCE, BUSINESS_LOGIC, SYSTEM_ERROR)
  - Custom exception classes (SecurityException, ValidationException, IntegrationException)
  - Comprehensive error context tracking
- **Files**: 
  - `src/classes/CVMAErrorHandler.cls` - Core error handling framework
  - `src/classes/CVMAErrorHandlerTest.cls` - Comprehensive test coverage
  - `src/objects/CVMA_Error_Log__c/` - Custom object for error logging

#### Enhanced Security Controllers
