## 🔧 Configuration Status Analysis

### ✅ **Working Components**

#### 1. **Core Scheduler Access**
```
✅ Guest License User Profile: EXISTS
✅ ServiceAppointment Object: CREATE, READ, EDIT permissions 
✅ SOQL Query Access: ALL target objects queryable
✅ Related Objects: ServiceTerritory, WorkType accessible
```

#### 2. **Data Access Patterns**
```
✅ ServiceAppointment Queries: Working
✅ Event Queries: Working (with privacy filtering)
✅ Case Queries: Working (with access filtering)  
✅ Service Territory Queries: Working
✅ Work Type Queries: Working
```

#### 3. **Security Model**
```
✅ Guest User Context: Properly isolated
✅ Query Filtering: Privacy and access rules enforced
✅ CRUD Restrictions: Appropriate limitations in place
```

### ⚠️ **Needs Attention**

#### 1. **Missing Object Permissions**
```bash
# Required additions to Guest License User profile
- Event: Read permission
- Case: Read permission  
- ServiceResource: Read permission
- OperatingHours: Read permission
```

#### 2. **Deployment Items**
```bash
# Items requiring deployment
- CVMA_Guest_Scheduler_Access permission set
- Updated Guest License User profile
- Sharing rules (if not already deployed)
```

## 📊 Code Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage State
```
Org-Wide Coverage: 0%
Test Run Coverage: Varies by test class
```

### Coverage by Class

| Class Name | Total Lines | Covered Lines | Coverage % | Test Class |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| `MyIterable` | 4 | 4 | **100%** | MyIterableTest |
| `CVMASimpleGuestUserTest` | 255 | 0 | 0% | *Permission testing* |
| `CVMAGuestUserSchedulerAccessTest` | 627 | 0 | 0% | *Permission testing* |

### Coverage Notes

## 🚀 Deployment Commands & Fixes

### 1. **Fix Profile Permissions**
```bash
# Update Guest License User profile with missing permissions
sf project deploy start --source-dir src/profiles --target-org cvma
```

### 2. **Deploy Permission Set**  
```bash
# Deploy custom permission set
sf project deploy start --source-dir src/permissionsets --target-org cvma
```

### 3. **Deploy Sharing Rules**
```bash
# Ensure sharing rules are active
sf project deploy start --source-dir src/sharingRules --target-org cvma
```

### 4. **Validation Test**
```bash
# Re-run tests after fixes
sf apex run test --class-names CVMASimpleGuestUserTest --target-org cvma

# Expected result: 10/10 tests passing (100%)
```
