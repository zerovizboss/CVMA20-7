4. **Notification System**: Slack/email notifications for status changes

### Project Board Automation
1. **Auto-move to Done**: When PR is merged and closes issue
2. **Auto-assign to Sprint**: Based on labels or milestones
3. **Blocked Item Alerts**: Notifications when items are blocked too long
4. **Sprint Completion Tracking**: Automatic sprint metrics calculation
